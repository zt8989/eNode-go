# IPv6 Client Implementation Spec (eNode-go)

How an eD2K/eMule client connects to eNode-go over IPv6 and exchanges IPv6
sources. This describes the **server's observable behaviour** — everything here is
implemented in eNode-go and byte-compatible with the eMuleAI / eMuleQt MOD-tag
scheme (`CT_MOD_*`, tag family `0xA0`–`0xAF`).

An IPv4-only client needs to do nothing: every classic packet is byte-identical
to the pre-IPv6 server. IPv6 is entirely additive and opt-in.

**Byte order:** every 16-byte IPv6 field is the raw `in6_addr` in network byte
order (big-endian, the order `inet_pton` produces and a textual `2001:db8::1`
reads left to right). No swapping. Send a genuine IPv6 in the 16-byte field and an
IPv4 in the existing 32-bit ClientID/IP fields — never an IPv4-mapped
(`::ffff:a.b.c.d`) form in a 16-byte field, since it will not compare equal to the
plain IPv4 on the peer side.

---

## 1. Transport: reaching the server over IPv6

eNode-go binds a **dual-stack** listener (single socket, `[::]`, `IPV6_V6ONLY=0`)
when `ipv6.enabled` (the default). It accepts both IPv4 and IPv6 client
connections on the same TCP and UDP ports. No separate v6 port.

A client that wants to connect over IPv6 needs, on its own side:

- an `AF_INET6` (dual-stack) socket for the server TCP and UDP connections;
- `AAAA` DNS resolution for a server given by hostname;
- a 16-byte IPv6 field in its server list / `server.met` equivalent, not a
  `uint32` IP.

A client that connects over IPv4 keeps working unchanged and may still advertise
its IPv6 (see §2) so it can be published as a v6 source.

---

## 2. Announcing IPv6 capability to the server

Two independent signals; either marks the session as "understands the IPv6 source
formats" (the server calls this *sentinel-safe*):

1. **Connect over IPv6.** A session whose TCP connection arrives on an IPv6
   address is treated as v6-capable automatically.
2. **Send `CT_MOD_IP_V6` in `OP_LOGINREQUEST`.** Add a hash tag carrying your
   public IPv6 and bump the login tag count. This is exactly what eMuleAI sends
   (`ServerConnect.cpp`).

Login tag on the wire (classic tag format — the server has not yet parsed your
`SRVCAP_NEWTAGS` when it reads the login tags, so use classic form):

```
01            TAGTYPE_HASH
01 00         name length = 1 (LE uint16)
AE            CT_MOD_IP_V6
<16 bytes>    your public IPv6, network byte order
```

Only send it for a **genuinely public** IPv6 (global unicast, not loopback,
link-local `fe80::/10`, or ULA `fc00::/7`). The server validates and drops a
non-public value, but still treats the tag's presence as the capability signal.

Optionally also set `SRVCAP_IPV6 (0x1000)` in the `CT_SERVER_FLAGS (0x20)` login
tag. This lets you announce "I speak the extension" even before you have a public
IPv6 to put in `0xAE`. The server reads `CT_SERVER_FLAGS` as a uint32.

> **Hard coordination rule.** Do **not** advertise v6 capability (connect over
> IPv6, or send `CT_MOD_IP_V6`) unless your client also implements the sentinel
> parser in §4. A sentinel-safe session may receive `0xFFFFFFFF` sentinel sources
> inside a classic `OP_FOUNDSOURCES`; a client that advertises capability but
> cannot parse the sentinel will desync its source list.

### ID assignment for IPv6-only clients

An ed2k ClientID is 32 bits and a HighID *is* the packed IPv4, so a client with no
usable IPv4 can never get a HighID. eNode-go assigns such a client a **LowID**
unconditionally and reaches it via its IPv6 (published as a v6 source). Such a
client can also drive and receive **IPv6 LowID callbacks** (§7). A dual-stack
client with a routable IPv4 still gets a HighID as usual.

---

## 3. Reading the server's IPv6 capability

- **Flags word.** `SRV_TCPFLG_IPV6 (0x4000)` in `OP_IDCHANGE` / `OP_SERVERIDENT`
  and `SRV_UDPFLG_IPV6 (0x4000)` in `OP_GLOBSERVSTATRES` indicate the server
  supports the IPv6 extension. Treat unknown flag bits as reserved and ignore
  them, as eMule does.
- **Server's own IPv6.** `OP_SERVERIDENT` carries a `CT_MOD_SVR_IP_V6 (0xAF)`
  hash tag (16 bytes) when the server has a public IPv6. Parse it position-
  agnostically among the ident tags; unknown tags before/after it must be
  consumed by type and skipped (a `TAGTYPE_HASH` tag is 16 bytes). This is
  informational — you still reach the server on the same address you connected to.
- **NAT-rendezvous capability.** `SRV_TCPFLG_NAT_RENDEZVOUS (0x8000)` in the flags
  word signals the server offers **server-independent** (cross-server / serverless)
  PR_NAT hole-punch rendezvous (§9): it will pair two registered clients regardless
  of which eD2K server, if any, they are logged into. When set, `OP_SERVERIDENT` also
  carries `ST_NAT_PORT (0x9D)`, a `TAGTYPE_UINT16` tag with the server's NAT-rendezvous
  UDP port (so you need not assume the default `2004`). Both are absent when the
  operator has turned the feature off; then only same-server LowID↔LowID is served.

---

## 4. Receiving IPv6 sources

Two formats. Implement **both** to be fully interoperable.

### 4a. Sentinel form — inside classic `OP_FOUNDSOURCES` / `OP_FOUNDSOURCES_OBFU`

The server sends this to a sentinel-safe session (see §2). A source whose only
routable address is IPv6 (a v6-only source, or a LowID source with a reachable
IPv6) is encoded with the ClientID sentinel `0xFFFFFFFF` followed by 16 IPv6
bytes. Per-source layout:

```
uint32 clientId                       // 0xFFFFFFFF marks an IPv6 source
uint16 port
[_OBFU only]        uint8  cryptOptions
[_OBFU && (cryptOptions & 0x80)]  uint8[16] userHash
[clientId == 0xFFFFFFFF]          uint8[16] ipv6   // ALWAYS the last field
```

The 16 IPv6 bytes come **after** the obfuscation fields. When you read
`clientId == 0xFFFFFFFF`, read the 16 bytes and create a source with that IPv6 and
the given port. A source with a real HighID (routable IPv4) is never sent as a
sentinel — you get its IPv4 form and should prefer it.

> A client that does not implement this branch **must not** be sentinel-safe (do
> not connect over IPv6 and do not send `CT_MOD_IP_V6`). Skipping the ClientID
> without consuming the 16 bytes desyncs the rest of the source list.

### 4b. Tag-block form — `OP_FOUNDSOURCES_IPV6` (0x25) / `OP_GLOBFOUNDSOURCES_IPV6` (0xA6)

The richer, unconditionally-safe format. You opt in by sending the request opcode;
the server replies in the extended layout only to a client that asked for it, so
there is no desync risk for anyone else.

Request (`OP_GETSOURCES_IPV6 0x24` TCP, `OP_GLOBGETSOURCES_IPV6 0xA5` UDP): same
payload as the classic `OP_GETSOURCES2` — `hash16` + file size (a zero `uint32`
size means a `uint64` size follows). UDP may repeat `hash16 + size` per file.

Reply:

```
hash16 fileHash
uint8  count
per source:
    uint32 clientId       // real ClientID, or 0xFFFFFFFF for a v6-only source
    uint16 port
    uint8  tagCount
    tags…                 // standard eD2K tags, uint8-counted
```

Recognised tags in the block:

| Tag | Value / type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CT_MOD_IP_V6` | `0xAE`, `TAGTYPE_HASH` (16 bytes) | the source's public IPv6 |

A source with no reachable IPv6 has `tagCount = 0` (just `clientId`+`port`), so the
block is a strict superset of the classic list. **Skip unknown tags by type** —
the block is forward-compatible and may gain tags (e.g. buddy IPv6, crypt options)
later.

> **Tag-type safety.** The block uses only `TAGTYPE_HASH` / `TAGTYPE_UINT8` and
> other length-determinable types — never `TAGTYPE_BOOL (0x05)` or
> `TAGTYPE_BOOLARRAY (0x06)`, which some parsers cannot length-skip.

### UDP framing

The server sends **one file block per datagram** for `OP_GLOBFOUNDSOURCES`. Do not
assume the vanilla `count * (4 + 2)` skip stride when coalescing — a sentinel
source carries extra bytes. The sentinel form is only ever sent over UDP to a
sender whose query arrived over IPv6; the tag-block form is sent only in reply to
`OP_GLOBGETSOURCES_IPV6`.

---

## 5. Choosing an address to connect to a source

When a source offers both an IPv4 (HighID) and an IPv6, prefer the family you have
working connectivity on; the server prefers giving you the IPv4 form when you have
a usable IPv4, and the IPv6 sentinel/tag when the source has no routable IPv4. A
v6-only source (`clientId == 0xFFFFFFFF`) is reachable only over IPv6.

---

## 6. What the server does not do

- Nothing NAT-related is scoped out any more: `PR_NAT` hole-punching is dual-stack —
  see **§9**. (When `natTraversal.ipv6` is set to `false`, the server declines IPv6
  `PR_NAT` datagrams and the family is IPv4-only, exactly as it was before v6 support.)

---

## 7. IPv6 LowID callbacks

A LowID callback lets a firewalled **target** be reached: a **requester** asks the
server to tell the target to connect *back* to the requester. Classic
`OP_CALLBACKREQUESTED (0x35)` carries `uint32 ip + uint16 port` (the requester's
IPv4), so it only works when the requester is directly reachable over IPv4 (HighID).
A requester whose only routable address is IPv6 — v6-only, or LowID over IPv4 —
could not be called back at all. eNode-go now closes that gap.

### Request (unchanged)

The requester still sends `OP_CALLBACKREQUEST (0x1C)` `<target LowID:uint32>`. The
LowID is the server-assigned 32-bit id; it is family-agnostic and needs no change.

### The server's family choice

The server picks the callback family from the **requester's** reachability, as two
independent checks:

1. If the requester has a HighID (a routable IPv4), the server sends the classic
   `OP_CALLBACKREQUESTED (0x35)` — byte-identical to before.
2. Otherwise (requester LowID over IPv4, or IPv4 `0`), if the requester has a
   **reachable public IPv6** and the target session is **v6-capable** (§2), the
   server sends `OP_CALLBACKREQUESTED_IPV6 (0x26)` so the target calls back over
   IPv6.
3. If neither applies, the server sends `OP_CALLBACKFAILED (0x36)`.

### `OP_CALLBACKREQUESTED_IPV6 (0x26)` — server → target

```
uint8      opcode = 0x26
uint8[16]  ipv6        // the requester's public IPv6, network byte order
uint16     port        // the requester's port (LE)
```

It is the classic packet widened from a 4-byte IPv4 to a 16-byte `in6_addr`, with
**no** crypt-options/userhash trailer (eNode-go's classic `0x35` emitter has none
either). On receipt, build the callback client from the 16 IPv6 bytes and the port
and connect to it over IPv6, exactly as you would `TryToConnect()` on the IPv4
address from `0x35`.

> **Capability gate.** The server only sends `0x26` to a session it knows is
> v6-capable (connected over IPv6, or sent `CT_MOD_IP_V6` at login — §2). A client
> that is not v6-capable never receives it, and a legacy client drops the unknown
> `0x26` opcode in its `ProcessPacket` default, so there is no desync risk.

---

## 8. IPv6 peer servers in `OP_SERVERLIST`

`OP_SERVERLIST (0x32)` advertises the other servers this node knows. The classic
packet is `<v4count:uint8>` then `v4count × (<ip:uint32 LE><port:uint16 LE>)`.
eNode-go widens it with a **trailing IPv6 block**, appended after the v4 entries:

```
uint8   v4count
v4count × ( uint32 ip (LE)   + uint16 port (LE) )      // classic block, unchanged
uint8   v6count                                         // present only when appended
v6count × ( uint8[16] ipv6 (network order) + uint16 port (LE) )
```

The trailing block is emitted only when IPv6 publication is on
(`ipv6.publishSources`) **and** at least one configured peer server carries a public
IPv6. When absent, the packet is byte-identical to the classic form — not even a
zero `v6count` byte is added.

### Why this needs no per-session capability gate

Unlike the source sentinel (§4a), which is *inline* and would desync a v4-only
parser, the server-list v6 block is pure **trailing data** after a self-terminating
`uint8` count. A v4-only parser reads exactly `v4count` entries and ignores the
rest (all three surveyed clients simply debug-dump it), so the same widened packet
is safe to send to every session. A v6-aware client, after consuming the `v4count`
entries, checks whether a `<v6count>` byte remains and, if so, reads that many
`<ipv6:16><port:2>` entries and builds each server from the 16-byte address.

### Configuring v6 peer servers

A `servers[].ip` entry in `enode.config.yaml` may be an IPv4 dotted-quad or a
**public** IPv6 literal. Non-public v6 (loopback, link-local `fe80::/10`, ULA
`fc00::/7`) and malformed entries are dropped at load and never advertised.

---

## 9. NAT traversal hole-punching (`PR_NAT`)

`PR_NAT (0xF1)` is a UDP hole-punch rendezvous service: the server relays each of
two firewalled peers the other's public endpoint so they can punch a hole directly
to each other. It covers the cases a direct connect or a callback cannot:

- **LowID ↔ LowID (IPv4).** Two peers both behind NAT with no reachable IPv4. The
  classic callback (`0x35`) needs the *requester* reachable, so it fails when both
  are LowID. Hole-punching does not.
- **Firewalled IPv6 ↔ firewalled IPv6.** Two peers each behind a stateful IPv6
  firewall. Neither can accept an inbound connection, so neither direct-reach nor the
  `0x26` callback (§7) works. This is the v6 analogue of LowID↔LowID.

This protocol exists only in eNode-go today; no C++ client implements it yet. This
section is the wire contract to implement against.

### Framing and byte order

Every `PR_NAT` datagram is `[0xF1][size:4 LE = payloadLen+1][opcode:1][payload]` —
the same envelope as `PR_ED2K`, but with its own opcode namespace (these opcodes are
interpreted only after the `0xF1` byte, so they do **not** collide with the
`PR_ED2K` opcodes `0x24/0x25/0x26`). A bare **1-byte** datagram (any value) is a
legacy keepalive.

> **Byte order is big-endian for every endpoint field in `PR_NAT`** — IP *and*
> port. This is deliberately unlike the LE convention used elsewhere in eD2K
> (including the `0x26` callback's LE port). Keep `PR_NAT` internally BE.

### Opcodes

| Opcode | Value | Dir | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OP_NAT_REGISTER` | `0xE4` | c→s / s→c | register request (hash); also the v4 register **ack** |
| `OP_NAT_REGISTER_EX` | `0xE3` | c→s | register request carrying a client version byte |
| `OP_NAT_REGISTER_IPV6` | `0xEC` | s→c | **v6 register ack** (new) |
| `OP_NAT_KEEPALIVE` | `0xE6` | c→s | keepalive (or a bare 1-byte datagram) |
| `OP_NAT_PING` | `0xE2` | s→c | keepalive ack |
| `OP_NAT_SYNC2` | `0xE9` | c→s | pair my hash with a target hash |
| `OP_NAT_SYNC` | `0xE1` | s→c | peer endpoint, v4 |
| `OP_NAT_SYNC_EX` | `0xE7` | s→c | peer endpoint, v4, + peer version |
| `OP_NAT_SYNC_IPV6` | `0xED` | s→c | **peer endpoint, v6** (new) |
| `OP_NAT_FAILED` | `0xE5` | s→c | pairing failed (reason byte) |

`0xE8/0xEA/0xEB/0xEF` (REPING/DATA/ACK/RST) are reserved and unused by eNode-go.

### Payload layouts (byte-exact)

```
REGISTER request  (c→s, 0xE4)   hash:16                       [+ legacy stats, ignored]
REGISTER_EX       (c→s, 0xE3)   hash:16  version:1
REGISTER ack v4   (s→c, 0xE4)   port:2 BE  ipv4:4 BE                              (6 B)

KEEPALIVE         (c→s, 0xE6)   (empty)          |  or a bare 1-byte datagram
PING              (s→c, 0xE2)   (empty)
```

- The register ack's `ipv4`/`ipv6` is the **server's own** public endpoint; the port
  is the UDP port the client should keep talking to. A client distinguishes the v4
  ack (6 B, opcode `0xE4`) from a register request by direction and length; the v6
  ack has its own opcode `0xEC`. An **all-zero** ack address means the server has no
  public address of that family to announce — keep using the address you dialed.
- `SYNC_IPV6` always carries `peerVersion` (0 if the peer registered without one);
  there is no separate EX form for v6.
- `FAILED` reason codes: `0x01` = target hash not registered; `0x02` = the two peers
  share no address family (e.g. a v4-only peer and a v6-only peer — they cannot
  punch); `0x03` = rendezvous restricted — the server has server-independent rendezvous
  turned off and one of the two peers is not logged into it (see *Cross-server /
  serverless rendezvous* below).

### Dual-stack candidate model

The server stores, **per user hash, up to two candidates** — one IPv4 and one IPv6 —
each being the source endpoint the server *observed* a register arrive from (it never
trusts a client-supplied address; NAT rewrites the source, and only the server sees
the translated public `ip:port`). A dual-stack client therefore **registers once per
family**: send `OP_NAT_REGISTER` from your IPv4 socket *and* from your IPv6 socket,
each carrying the same user hash. Each keeps its own freshness (TTL, default 30 s), so
keepalive on every family you registered.

At `SYNC2` time the server picks a **common family, preferring IPv6**: v6 if both
peers have a v6 candidate, else v4 if both have v4, else `FAILED 0x02`. So register
every family you can offer before `SYNC2`; at minimum register on the family of the
target source (which you already know from the source record).

### Sequence

```
target T                         server                        initiator I
  --OP_NAT_REGISTER(hashT)------->  store T.<fam>=src ; ack
  <-------------- REGISTER ack ----
  --OP_NAT_KEEPALIVE------------->  refresh ; <--- OP_NAT_PING
                                                   <--OP_NAT_REGISTER(hashI)--
                                                   store I.<fam>=src ; ack --->
                                                   <--OP_NAT_SYNC2(hashI,connAck,hashT)--
  <-- SYNC/ SYNC_IPV6(peer=I) ----  pick family ; relay ---> SYNC/ SYNC_IPV6(peer=T)
  ============ direct UDP punch between T and I (both mappings now open) ============
```

The **punch payload itself is not part of `PR_NAT`** — once each side has the peer's
endpoint it opens its own eD2K connection to it. (The reference simulator
`internal/natsim` sends `"PING"`/`"PONG"` there purely to prove reachability.)

### Cross-server / serverless rendezvous

The registry above is keyed by **user hash**, not by eD2K login: registering and
pairing are independent of whether the two peers are logged into this server, a
different server, or no server at all. This is what lets `PR_NAT` reach LowID↔LowID
pairs that the classic same-server callback cannot — the two peers on **different
servers or none** rendezvous through a common server that runs `PR_NAT`.

**How a client uses it (client side — the discovery half):**

1. **Detect** a rendezvous-capable server: `SRV_TCPFLG_NAT_RENDEZVOUS (0x8000)` in its
   flags word, and read `ST_NAT_PORT (0x9D)` from `OP_SERVERIDENT` for the UDP port
   (fall back to `2004` if absent). This may be a server you are logged into, or any
   public server you choose as your rendezvous **R**.
2. A firewalled target **T** registers with **R** (`OP_NAT_REGISTER`, keepalive) and
   learns **R**'s public endpoint from the REGISTER ack. T then **publishes** the pair
   `(its user hash, R's ip:port)` to its peers — via Kad or source-exchange, the same
   channel that carries any other contact info. eNode-go does **not** propagate this;
   carrying and reading it is the client's responsibility.
3. An initiator **I** that has learned `(hashT, R)` for a source sends
   `OP_NAT_SYNC2(hashI, connAck, hashT)` to **R** (SYNC2 auto-registers I's endpoint,
   so a prior REGISTER is optional). R pairs them exactly as in the sequence above and
   both punch — regardless of which servers I and T use for file discovery.

This is orthogonal to and independent of the eMuleAI **eServer buddy** relay
(`OP_ESERVER_* 0xB3–0xBB`), which is a client-to-client, **same-server**, IPv4-only
mechanism the eD2K server takes no part in. `PR_NAT` is the server-mediated path that
spans servers and covers IPv6.

**Gate.** `natTraversal.serverIndependent` (default **true**) controls this. When on,
the server pairs any two registered hashes and advertises the flag + `ST_NAT_PORT`.
When off, it drops both advertisements and refuses a `SYNC2` unless **both** hashes are
currently logged into it, replying `OP_NAT_FAILED` reason `0x03`; same-server
LowID↔LowID still works. The gate is family-agnostic — it applies equally to IPv4 and
IPv6 pairings, before family selection.

### Configuration

- `natTraversal.enabled` — run the service at all.
- `natTraversal.port` — its UDP port (default `2004`). The handler is also reachable
  on the main UDP port.
- `natTraversal.ipv6` — dual-stack hole-punching (default **true**). Effective only
  when `ipv6.enabled` is also on. When off, the server **declines** IPv6 `PR_NAT`
  datagrams (drops them, no ack, nothing stored) and the protocol is IPv4-only.
- `natTraversal.serverIndependent` — cross-server / serverless rendezvous (default
  **true**). When off, pairing is restricted to clients logged into this server
  (`OP_NAT_FAILED` reason `0x03` otherwise) and the capability flag + `ST_NAT_PORT` tag
  are not advertised.
