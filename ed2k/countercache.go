// defaultCounterCacheTTL bounds how stale the advertised client and file counts
// may be. These feed the totals in OP_SERVERSTATUS and OP_GLOBSERVSTATRES, which
// clients only display — nothing branches on them — so ten seconds is invisible
// to a user and is already far fresher than the five-minute cadence at which any
// client is told anything.
//
// The TTL is deliberately not tied to ServerStatusInterval: it is what bounds
// the cost of a UDP status flood, which arrives at whatever rate an attacker
// chooses.

// counterCache serves ClientsCount and FilesCount from one shared, briefly
// cached reading.
//
// Both callers issued two COUNT(*) queries per call: the per-client status
// ticker (one goroutine per logged-in client) and udpGlobServStatReq, which is
// unauthenticated and unthrottled. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients WHERE online=1`
// had no index to use, so a UDP status flood turned into unbounded concurrent
// full table scans — cheap to send, expensive to serve.
//
// Refresh is lazy rather than driven by a background ticker. A ticker costs
// 2/TTL queries per second unconditionally, so it only pays off above roughly
// interval/TTL concurrent clients (~30 at the defaults) and is a straight
// regression below that — on a single-client server it would turn 0.007 q/s into
// 0.2 q/s. Refreshing on read is never worse than not caching, and still caps
// cost at 2/TTL under any load.
